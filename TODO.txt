General
=======
* Schema for the xml
* Better selection of the base image
-- In real life for OpenShift we probably want to use the latest
-- But I need to be able to use the multiarch one
-- Also we probably want some kind of 'staging' for upcoming images
* I don't think the user should need to specify the WildFly version. Rather that is the job of the managed service to use the latest.
-- Same for the other feature packs we ship?
-- What about user feature packs. Is that something we will support?

Docker image
============
* Needs the tool jar, and the server-image-builder, which is just the pom.xml
- Run the tool to update the pom.xml
- Run the maven build to provision the server and create the image
* How to name the image?
* Once built where should it be pushed to?

Later
======
* Metrics about how it is running - we need to know who is using what
-- Where is this stored?


Done
====
* Use processing instruction in the pom.xml to be replaced with the eap.xml contents
* Add CLI files in known location in the jar
* YAML as an alternative to CLI configuration
